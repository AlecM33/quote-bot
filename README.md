# Features

Don't you wish you could quickly immortalize the great things your friends say in your discord server? This bot allows you to save quotes and later have them quoted back to you.

- save quotes by any number of specified authors
- pull random quotes by any author
- get statistics including who has said how many quotes
- more coming soon...

# Tech Stack

The bot is written in javascript and makes heavy use of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). 

I currently host the bot using the [Heroku Cloud Platform](https://heroku.com), and use a free add-on to provision a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/), where I store the quotes for the single server where the bot operates.
