    TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT

    This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between AlecM33 ("Bot Owner") and the user ("User") of the Quote Bot Discord bot (the "Bot").

    By using the Bot, the User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the User does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, they should immediately discontinue use of the Bot.

    1. Use of the Bot: The Bot Owner grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Bot for personal or non-commercial purposes.
    2. Prohibited Use: The User may not use the Bot in any way that violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations or infringes upon the rights of any third party. The User may not use the Bot for any commercial purposes without the express written consent of the Bot Owner.
    3. Limitation of Liability: The Bot Owner shall not be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, or other intangible losses.
    4. Modifications to the Bot: The Bot Owner may modify or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice. The User agrees that the Bot Owner shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Bot.
    5. Termination: This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time for any reason. Upon termination, the User must immediately cease all use of the Bot.
    6. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, whether written or oral, relating to the Bot.

    By using the Bot, the User acknowledges that they have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.

<pre>
    Quotes added in a particular server can only be retrieved by users in that server. The bot stores quotes in a secure
    database to which only the bot and its creator have access. The data is only used for this bot and its associated commands.
    For safety, the bot will not accept quotes that produce hyperlinks, but other than that, it does not attempt to moderate
    quote content. Quote content moderation is thus only about as good as your server's moderation.
